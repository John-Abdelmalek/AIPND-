This is the final project for Udacity's AI programming with Python nanodegree.

Goal:
    To train an image classifier to correctly identify 102 classes of flowers. I used a pretrained model from torchvision.models to get image features,
    built and trained a new feed-forward classifier using those images' features.
    Acceptable accuracy for the trained models is around 70% (and the higher the better).

Files:
Image Classifier Project.html : HTML file of the notebook of the project.

Image Classifier Project.ipynb: notebook of the project.

train.py:  To train the model.
    Input:
        Basic usage: 
            python train.py data_directory
            
        Optional usage in addition to basic:
            --save_dir data_directory
            --arch "densenet121"
            --learning_rate 0.001
            --hidden_units 512
            --epochs 7

predict.py :  To use the model to make predictions, after having been trained.
    Input: 
        Basic usage: 
            python predict.py /path/to/image checkpoint  
            
        Optional usage in addition to basic:
            --top_k 5
            --gpu
            category_names cat_to_name.json
            
utility.py: Contains the process_image and load_checkpoint functions.
